# WHITE PAPER: TIGR REPUBLIC
**Version:** 1.0 (Genesis Edition)  
**Date:** February 8, 2026  
**Status:** Internal R&D / Technical Preview  
**Architect:** Founder

## 1. Abstract
TIGR Republic is an experimental **decentralized governance protocol** operating on the Solana blockchain. The project aims to create a functional model of digital democracy that eliminates the need for central intermediaries, replacing them with transparent code (**Code is Law**). The system is designed to transition into full autonomy following the completion of the Research and Development (R&D) phase, adhering to the principles of decentralization.

## 2. Problem and Solution
**Problem:** Traditional governance models suffer from opacity, susceptibility to power abuse, and oligarchy.  
**TIGR Solution:**
* **Immutable Ledger:** All decisions and value flows are transparent and publicly auditable on the blockchain.
* **Meritocracy:** Influence within the network is determined not only by capital but by proven integrity, education, and activity (**Merit**).
* **Self-Custody:** Users maintain exclusive control over their assets; there is no central custodian of property.
* **Sybil Resistance:** Individual Power Limit (IPL) and a deposit system eliminate bots and fake identities.  
  * *IPL ensures that no single entity can gain absolute control over voting through mere capital accumulation – influence is capped in favor of the human majority.*

## 3. Technological Architecture
The project utilizes the **Solana** blockchain for its high throughput and low costs.
* **Smart Contracts:** Governance logic is enforced by programs (smart contracts) that cannot be retroactively altered (following the Awakening phase).
* **On-Chain Governance:** Voting on network parameters occurs directly on the blockchain.
* **Security:** The system is **non-custodial** — the Architect does not hold users' private keys.

## 4. Citizenship Model (Genesis Mode)
Access to the network (Citizenship) is strictly separated from financial speculation during the R&D phase.
* **No Token Purchase:** Citizenship is not acquired by purchasing TIGR tokens.
* **Civic Deposit (S-01/S-02):** Participants provide a refundable technical deposit in the network's native asset (**SOL valued at $10 USD for Legates / $30 USD for Tribunes**).
* **Deposit Function:** Serves as protection against spam (Sybil resistance) and proof of integrity. The deposit is held in an independent smart contract (Escrow) and is fully refundable upon formal exit from the network.

## 5. Tokenomics and Utility Functions
In this phase, the **TIGR** token does not serve as an investment tool but as **governance fuel**.
* **Token Role:** Voting rights, slashing penalties for network attacks, and rewards for operating Ghost Mesh nodes.
* **Evolution:** The transition to utilizing TIGR tokens for deposits is technically permitted **only after full decentralization (Awakening)**, eliminating founder influence over market demand.
* **Founder Allocation:** 0.0% unlocked tokens. All allocations are either locked (**Vesting: 36 months**) or were transparently acquired from the public market (**Skin in the Game**).

## 6. Roadmap (The Path to Autonomy)
1. **Genesis Phase (Present):** Internal testing, R&D, centralized parameter protection. **Goal: Validation of 150 Legates and 150 Tribunes and the filling of all seats within the governance bodies.**
2. **Awakening Phase:** Automatic activation upon reaching critical mass. Revocation of the Architect's administrative rights. Handover of control to on-chain governance.
3. **Sovereignty Phase:** Fully autonomous network operation and activation of the Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL).

## 7. Legal and Regulatory Framework
The architecture is designed in compliance with EU Regulation 2023/1114 (MiCA).
* **Full Decentralization:** The project aims for the model defined in **Recital 22 of MiCA**, which exempts fully decentralized protocols without an intermediary from CASP licensing requirements.
* **Absence of Public Offering:** The project does not conduct a public offering of securities or investment tokens. Entry is managed through a refundable SOL deposit and integrity examinations.
